TASK 2 MECHANICAL TRACK 



üéÅ Automated Gift Shop Robot ‚Äì 3D Tinkercad Project

Project Objective

To design an intelligent robot that automates a gift shop by transporting gift boxes from a conveyor belt to a packaging box without human intervention.  
This 3D project was created using Tinkercad to simulate a real-world automated system.

Project Requirements

1. Design a robot with a functional robotic arm.
2. Create a 3D environment representing a gift shop with shelves and boxes.
3. Add a **conveyor belt** that carries gift boxes to the robot.
4. The robot picks up each box and places it into a packaging box.
5. Write an **algorithm** that describes the robot's task.
6. Define the **Working Envelope** (the robot's operating space).

Robot Movement Algorithm
1. Gift boxes move along the conveyor belt.
2. The robot detects when a box reaches the pickup area.
3. The robotic arm moves down to pick up the box.
4. It transfers the box to the packaging container.
5. The arm returns to its original position.
6. The process repeats for each incoming box.
